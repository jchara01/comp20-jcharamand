# comp20-jcharamand / notuber

This Lab consists of creating a page that displays a Google Map of all 6 of the listed vehicles. There are four files: index.html, myuber.js, map.css and car.png. The way I approached this lab is by coding all the files as though they were one. I ran the code and kept fixing it until it seemed alright. After i made sure the map that i wanted was displayed with the right specifications and the right code, i worked on dividing the code to the corresponding JavaScript and CSS files. It seems the majority of the work has been implemented correctly since the display seems correct, however, i am still unsure why it does not display correctly on my personal browser. In order to complete the lab I had access to the Comp 20 piazza page, where I posted whatever inquiries I had and where a lot of the figuring out of my errors happened with the help of Ming. I also used google and resources provided by the professor on the Comp 20 web page quite offen to figure out the basic html and css syntax. The lab took me about 5 to 6 hours to complete.
