# comp20-jcharamand / notuber

This Lab consists of populating the map with dynamic content, such that when a ride is requested by the user, available vehicles will apear on the map. There are four files: index.html, myuber.js, map.css and car.png. The way I approached this lab is by first and foremost figuring out how to redo Lab 9, but dynamically using XMLHttpRequest and JSON parse (inpired by Lab 7). I later continued by creating a function to calculate the distance between every vehicle and the user, and figured out how to implement it in the rest of my code. Building off of that I set an infowindow on the user's marker to display that same distance for only the closest driver. I finally finished by setting a polyline linking the user and that same vehicle. It seems the majority of the work has been implemented correctly since the display seems correct, however, i am still unsure why it does not display correctly on my personal browser. In order to complete the lab I had access to the Comp 20 piazza page, where I posted whatever inquiries I had and where a lot of the figuring out of my errors happened with the help of Ming. I also used google and resources provided by the professor on the Comp 20 web page quite offen to figure out the basic html and css syntax. The lab took me about 8 to 9 hours to complete.
