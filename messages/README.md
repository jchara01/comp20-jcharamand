# comp20-jcharamand / messages

This Lab consists of parsing data in JSON format and practice outputting tthe data to a section of a completely loaded HTML file. There is only one file: index.html. The way I approached this lab is by setting up JSON.parse() and i proceeded by figuring out how to output the messages in the specific "messages" section of thr HTML. It seems the majority of the work has been implemented correctly since the display seems correct. However, it is always possible that i have missed something that i did not implement perfectly. In order to complete the lab I had access to the Comp 20 piazza page, where I posted whatever inquiries I had. I also used google and resources provided by the professor on the Comp 20 web page quite offen to figure out the basic html and css syntax. The lab took me about 3 to 4 hours to complete.
