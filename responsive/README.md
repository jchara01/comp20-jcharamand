This Lab foucses on CSS sprites given an index.html file and an image software.png. The goal is to create a css file that helps adjust the display of the given image depending on the different browser screen widths.The way I approached this lab is by ... However, it is always possible that i have missed something that i did not implement perfectly. In order to complete the lab I had access to the Comp 20 piazza page, where I posted whatever inquiries I had. I also used google and resources provided by the professor on the Comp 20 web page quite offen to figure out the basic html and css syntax. The lab took me about 2 to 3 hours to complete.
