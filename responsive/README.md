# comp20-jcharamand/responsive

This Lab foucses on CSS sprites given an index.html file and an image software.png. The goal is to create a css file that helps adjust the display of the given image depending on the different browser screen widths. The way I thought of approaching this lab is by firstly setting the given image as the background, then adjusting it depending on the browser width. It has not been perfectly implemented seeing as my image is responsive but not as the lab conditions specify. In order to complete the lab I had access to the Comp 20 piazza page, where I posted whatever inquiries I had. I also used google and resources provided by the professor on the Comp 20 web page quite offen to figure out the basic html and css syntax. The lab took me about 4 hours to complete.
