# comp20-jcharamand / security
This Lab consists of documenting and resolving the security and privacy issues of a ride-hailing service. The way i approached the search for security vulnerabilities for the given service is by first and foremost testing it and playing around with it before reading the source code, which is in fact called Behavioral Testing in that the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. This test was used in order to detect errors such as incorrect or missing functions, interface errors, errors in external database access... When I was done with that first test, I carried on by reviewing the provided source code in order to scrutinize for more vulnerabilities. In order to identify some of the vulnerabilities, I had to research and read about NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB), as i also explored the resources provided on Canvas. It seems the majority of the work has been done correctly since the issues and their solutions seem legitimate. However, it is always possible that i have missed something that i did not analyze perfectly. In order to complete the lab I had access to the Comp 20 piazza page, where I posted whatever inquiries I had. I also used google and resources provided by the professor on the Comp 20 web page quite often to figure out the basic vulnerabilities. The lab took me about 8 to 9 hours to complete.
