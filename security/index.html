      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I have been hired to to document and resolve the security and privacy issues of a ride-hailing service. 
        The ride-hailing service is in fact a web application that consists of accessing a server which provides an API for
        a client-apllication to receive information about vehicles in the vicinity (username, lat,lng), and to submit information
        about them (client username and their location). In addition, the server has an interface that shows all the checkins to the server.</p>
      <br />
        
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p> The way i approached the search for security vulnerabilities for the given service is by first and foremost testing it 
        and playing around with it before reading the source code, which is in fact called Behavioral Testing in that the 
        internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. This test was used in order
        to detect errors such as incorrect or missing functions, interface errors, errors in external database access...
        When I was done with that first test, I carried on by reviewing the provided source code in order to scrutinize for
        more vulnerabilities. In order to identify some of the vulnerabilities, I had to research and read about NoSQL databases
        (such as MongoDB), as i also explored the resources provided on Canvas.

      <h2>Issues Found</h2>
      <ol> 
        <li> Query Injection </li>
        <p> </p>
        <li> Injection of HTML and Javascript into client-side </li>
        <p>  </p>
        <li> CORS vulnerability </li>
        <img src="CORSattack.jpg">
        <p> As one can see, we have a '*' wildcard as value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in response and 
          it means all domains are allowed to access the server response and it is an insecure configuration for CORS.
          There is another type of CORS attack. If a random domain is sent as value of origin header in request and 
          one gets the same domain name as value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in response, it means a random
          domain was successfully trusted to get the CORS responses. </p>
        <br /> 
         <p> Severity: High. </p>
        <p> Attacks with several goals could take place: the first one could be the exploitation of Cross-Site Request Forgery;
        CSRF refers to an instance where the attacker can send a complex set of requests to the server even with session cookies,
        as they implement the whole attack in JavaScript so that when the user loads the attacker’s malicious website, the JavaScript 
        can immediately start to send requests to the target. The second goal of the attack could be to interact  with the internal 
        network. If the user loads the attacker’s website, that essentially means that the attacker can execute 
        code in the internal network and simply attack a known internal service which they have no access to.</p> 
        <br />
    <p> Solution: To implement CORS securely, it would be ideal to associate a validation list with Access-Control-Allow-Origin 
      that identifies which specific domains can access resources. Then the application can validate against this list 
      when a domain requests access.</p> 
    </ol>
