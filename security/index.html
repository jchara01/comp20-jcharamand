      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I have been hired to document and resolve the security and privacy issues of a ride-hailing service. 
        The ride-hailing service is in fact a web application that consists of accessing a server which provides an API for
        a client-application to receive information about vehicles in the vicinity (username, latitude, longitude), and to submit information
        about them (client username and their location). In addition, the server has an interface that shows all the checkins to the server.</p>
      <br />
        
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p> The way i approached the search for security vulnerabilities for the given service is by first and foremost testing it 
        and playing around with it before reading the source code, which is in fact called Behavioral Testing in that the 
        internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. This test was used in order
        to detect errors such as incorrect or missing functions, interface errors, errors in external database access...
        When I was done with that first test, I carried on by reviewing the provided source code in order to scrutinize for
        more vulnerabilities. In order to identify some of the vulnerabilities, I had to research and read about NoSQL databases
        (such as MongoDB), as i also explored the resources provided on Canvas.
      </p>
      <br />
      
      <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
      <p>
        In our modern world, web applications have been designed to be fast, transactional, and to be very easy to use. However,
        as advanced and as modern applications seem to be, security mostly never is the number one priority. From that stems a variety
        of security vulnerabilities which allow easy, supposedly unauthorized, access to people with not-so-great intentions. 
        By that, I mean instances where information that should be  private, turns out to  be easily accessible (whether the web
        application's or the user's).
      </p>
      <br />
    
      <h2>Issues Found</h2>
      <ol> 
        <li> Query Injection </li>
        <img src="QUERYinj.jpg">
        <p> It consists of querying a NoSQL database (such as, in our case, MongoDB) by using function such as "request.query.username"
        to gain unauthorized access  to information within the database. </p>
        <br /> 
         <p> Severity: High. </p>
        <p> The attacker is enabled access to unauthorized data from the server. The server is only meant to provide the
        usernames of the  passenger and the  vehicle that are authorized in the server, which could be  bypassed by the attacker.</p> 
        <br />
    <p> Solution: Ensuring that the queried JSON object uniquely contains a value that is a string and not another JSON object, considering that
      "request.query" is a JavaScript object.</p> 
        
        
        <li> Injection of HTML and JavaScript into client-side </li>
        <img src="HTMLJAVAinj.jpg">
        <p> Cross site scripting (XSS) is a common attack vector that injects malicious code (JavaScript or HTML) into 
          a vulnerable web application.  </p>
        <br /> 
         <p> Severity: High. </p>
        <p> XSS differs from other web attack vectors in that it does not 
          directly target the application itself. Instead, the users of the web application are the ones at risk.</p> 
        <br />
    <p> Solution: Escape functions can be used to negate the usage of characters like (&, <, >, ", ', /) to prevent switching into any execution 
      context, such as script, style, or event handlers. Using hex entities is recommended in the spec. For example, it could be possible to 
      make these substitutions: 
      <p>&  -->  & amp; </p>
      <p> <  -->  & lt; </p>
      <p> >  --> & gt;</p>
      <p> "  --> & quot; </p>
      <p> '  --> & #x27; </p>
      <p> /  --> & #x2F; </p>
    </p>
      <br/>
        
        
        <li> CORS vulnerability </li>
        <img src="CORSattack.jpg">
        <p> As one can see, we have a '*' wildcard as value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in response and 
          it means all domains are allowed to access the server response and it is an insecure configuration for CORS.
          There is another type of CORS attack. If a random domain is sent as value of origin header in request and 
          one gets the same domain name as value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in response, it means a random
          domain was successfully trusted to get the CORS responses. </p>
        <br /> 
         <p> Severity: High. </p>
        <p> Attacks with several goals could take place: the first one could be the exploitation of Cross-Site Request Forgery;
        CSRF refers to an instance where the attacker can send a complex set of requests to the server even with session cookies,
        as they implement the whole attack in JavaScript so that when the user loads the attacker’s malicious website, the JavaScript 
        can immediately start to send requests to the target. The second goal of the attack could be to interact  with the internal 
        network. If the user loads the attacker’s website, that essentially means that the attacker can execute 
        code in the internal network and simply attack a known internal service which they have no access to.</p> 
        <br />
    <p> Solution: To implement CORS securely, it would be ideal to associate a validation list with Access-Control-Allow-Origin 
      that identifies which specific domains can access resources. Then the application can validate against this list 
      when a domain requests access.</p> 
    </ol>
    
    
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
      The server-side of the Ride Hailing Service application shows vulnerabilities primarily with accessing the database.
       NoSQL databases are typically used for quick implementations to make a basic web application in ready shape to be up and running.
       In that, they are blatant for these kinds of issues that result from bad implementation habits in order to "make life easier" for
        the programmer. However, with the provided solutions to the issues found, the web application subject of the following
        assessment would be a great service to replace your Uber app!
