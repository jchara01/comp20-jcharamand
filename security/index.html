      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I have been hired to to document and resolve the security and privacy issues of a ride-hailing service. The ride-hailing service is in fact a web application that consists of accessing a server which then returns to the client  information about the vehicles in the vicinity, how far the closest vehicle is to them, and provides details about the driver of that vehicle. </p>
