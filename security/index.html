      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I have been hired to to document and resolve the security and privacy issues of a ride-hailing service. 
        The ride-hailing service is in fact a web application that consists of accessing a server which provides an API for
        a client-apllication to receive information about vehicles in the vicinity (username, lat,lng), and to submit information
        about them (client username and their location). In addition, the server has an interface that shows all the checkins to the server.</p>
      <br />
        
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p> The way i approached the search for security vulnerabilities for the given service is by first and foremost testing it 
        and playing around with it before reading the source code, which is in fact called Behavioral Testing in that the 
        internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. This test was used in order
        to detect errors such as incorrect or missing functions, interface errors, errors in external database access...
        When I was done with that first test, I carried on by reviewing the provided source code in order to scrutinize for
        more vulnerabilities. In order to identify some of the vulnerabilities, I had to research and read about NoSQL databases
        (such as MongoDB), as i also explored the resources provided on Canvas.
