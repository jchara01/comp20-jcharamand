      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I have been hired to to document and resolve the security and privacy issues of a ride-hailing service. 
        The ride-hailing service is in fact a web application that consists of accessing a server which provides an API for
        a client-apllication to receive information about vehicles in the vicinity (username, lat,lng), and to submit information
        about them (client username and their location). In addition, the server has an interface that shows all the checkins to the server.</p>
